Project Description

This project is focused on developing a web-based system to analyse malicious attacks using a Hybrid Machine Learning model. 
It will also predict the cyber-physical systems behavioural analysis. Cyber attackers create and use malware to steal personal and professional 
details for different reasons.

Despite advancements in network security, timely identification, detection and analysis of malicious activities is still a 
significant challenge for individuals and organisations. Plenty of useful data could be collated from diverse sources for 
various potential purposes such as identification, classification and visualisation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security protocols.

Problem statement/rationale:

The key problem of this cohort is to look for the right set of useful data, and open-ended applications to develop Hybrid Machine learning Algorithms
 and develop a web-based system to analyse various malicious attacks. With suitable case-study contexts, your team need to

    Identify and explore various malicious attacks
    Explore publicly available datasets for malware detection
    Design and develop Hybrid machine learning models to identify and analyse malicious attacks.
    Explore and implement different Machine Learning techniques to predict the cyber-physical systems behavioural analysis

Project requirements:

    Identify and analyse relevant data sets.
    Explore and develop a range of malware classification and analysis ML models.
    Explore and implement different techniques to the cyber-physical systems behavioural analysis
    Build a web-based system to incorporate the above points (1-3). 

The detailed scope of the project will be determined in discussion with the student teams.

Project Resources

    A Windows PC or Mac computer with internet access will be required.
    The development environment (Mac or Windows) and programming language(s) to be used will depend on the existing skills on the 
    team members and will be chosen in consultation with the Project Supervisors.

Project Planning

Phase 1: Week 1 to week 3

    Team formation and role selection
    Task, document, and project management formation/document creation
    Brainstorming the project objectives and selecting research topics

Phase 2: Week 4 to Week 6

    Develop knowledge on chosen platforms and possible development
    Start designing the prototypes along with your team
    Finalise prototypes and receive feedback

Phase 3: Week 7 to Week 9

    Design and development of the selected prototypes (systems)

Phase 4: Week 10 to week 12

    Testing and evaluation of the implemented systems
    Project presentation and demonstration
    Product delivery

Project Deliverables

All students are expected to deliver the following for evaluation:

    Research report
    Innovation concept
    Team project demonstration and presentation
    Individual project report

Note:

    For a group of 5 members, 5 prototype designs will be initially proposed, out of them 3 best designs (selected by the client) are going to be implemented.
    Likewise, for a group of 4 members, 4 prototype designs will be initially proposed, out of them 3 best designs (selected by the client) are going to be implemented.
