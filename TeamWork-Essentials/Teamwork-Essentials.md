1.4 Team Work Essentials
Teamwork

Teamwork is a requirement of this unit. As you may be new to teamwork, especially in a University study environment, teamwork resources have been suggested to support you and help you get to know your peers and form a team. Participation of all team members will help you form a high-performing team set up for success.

Teamwork can be hard emotionally and intellectually, causing frustration and conflict. Many problems in teams stem from anxiety and misunderstanding; however, in the process, you will learn how to deal with challenges and conflict, develop your communication skills and look at things from others' perspectives. Essentially it's the same when collaborating on a team project within a workplace environment.

The teamwork essentials document outlines the policies we use to help you manage your team and any difficulties that might arise in it. Everyone NEEDS to read this as it outlines, amongst other things, how students can QUIT from their team if things are not working and can FIRE teammates who are not contributing.
Team communication

In this unit, we expect you to communicate through Mircosoft Teams as a teamwork tool and use the formal Swinburne email only (Outlook) to discuss with your team members. It is important for you and your team members to keep all communication evidence if any team member is not responding for more than 2 weeks. Then you and your team should follow the process below 

    Email your workshop facilitator and cc all your team members in regard to the inactive not responding team member 
    Facilitator will take action and try to contact the student through email, if the student is not responding in 24 to 48 hours then the matter will be taken to the Unit Convenor
    The unit Convenor will contact the student through email if there is no response from the inactive team member 
    Lastly, the Unit Convenor discusses with the team and take a decision to remove the inactive team member from the team

Don't try to do this process just before your first team assessment submission (week 7). The team has to inform about the team issue by week 3 or 4. 
Teamwork Expectations

    All team members must attend all on-campus workshops if anyone is not participating in a team-based workshop reflection activity. The absent team member will not be graded.
    If a team member is not attending more than 2 workshops, the team should report to the facilitator to take action.
    Teams should work with all team members. You are a team NOT a collection of individuals.
    Don't submit your teamwork assessments as individual work; each completes a different part of the assignment then stapling these different parts together and submitting them.
    Collaborate and communicate with all team members through valid channels such as Swinburne Email, Canvas group discussion page, and Microsoft Teams.
    Don't use Discord for formal communications. We will not accept your discord communications as evidence if any problem arises between team members.
    Just messaging each other on tasks and asking for updates is not enough, everyone in the team should take the initiative to complete the weekly expectations.
    Team meetings are important not in Discord, Make a proper time every week for an online or on-campus meeting.
    Don't meet your team members only during workshop sessions.
